# AI_TOP
The project AI TOP focuses on using AI to help students with disabilities by recognizing signs of distress and predicting crisis.

For now there are only 3.5 files, but I will soon upload the rest of the scripts, and will keep the repo up to date.

The main file is the Demo.py, it is a GUI that allows to try the real-time action recognition demo. For now it only recognizes: no action, hand biting, head scratching, covering face and covering ears, but it will be expanded. If the checkbox in the GUI is checked, the software will record videos that will be found in a folder called data_to_label. If you wish to help the cause, you are free to collect the data and then contact me so that we can get in touch and use your data for research.

GUI.py is a more elaborate version of the demo, it opens a gui where one can choose to predict or to record any of the listed actions. If you wish to record the actions, follow the protocol explained in the gui.

The functions file is a set of functions used by the Demo file and by other files that will be uploaded, so make sure to have them both in the same folder or the demo won't run.

If you have any questions, ideas or feedback don't hesitate to contact me, thanks and enjoy!
